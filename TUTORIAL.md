# Zoom Apps AI Assistant Tutorial

### Introduction

Zoom Apps are a great way to extend the Zoom experience and add additional functionality to your meetings. 
In this tutorial, we'll walk through how to build a simple AI assistant Zoom App that uses [Recall.ai](https://recall.ai) to perform transcription and [Anthropic.ai](https://antropic.ai) to generate summaries.

In this guide we will walk through the process of building an AI assistant Zoom App from scratch.
Including how to:

 - Create a Zoom App
 - Setup a backend to receive real-time meeting data
 - Integrate with [Recall.ai](https://recall.ai) to perform transcription
 - Integrate with [Anthropic.ai](https://antropic.ai) to generate summaries
 - Setup a frontend to display transcripts and summaries

We will use the following technologies to build our app:

 - React for the frontend
 - Express/Node.js for the backend

### Context

In order to receive this data, a meeting bot has to join the call and process the data.
Historically, building apps which interact with meeting data in real-time has been a challenge.
This is because of the infrastructure required to build and maintain the bot.

In this demo we will showcase how simple has become to build a Zoom App which can interact with meeting data in real-time and provide value to your users.
Using Recall.ai, we are able to perform transcription on the meeting data in real-time and retrieve the transcript via a webhook using a simple API.

Likewise, providing tangible value from meeting data has also been difficult.
But with the advent of foundational model API's, such as Anthropic's Claude, it has never been easier to make use of meeting data.
